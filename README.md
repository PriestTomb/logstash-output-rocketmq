# logstash-output-rocketmq

Logstash plugin output to Rocketmq

[中文说明](https://github.com/PriestTomb/logstash-output-rocketmq/blob/master/README_zh.md)

## Description

I am not skilled in Logstash, Rocketmq and Ruby (in addition, my english is not good too...), just because there are no official or third-party rocketmq output plugin found on the web. **This is just a demo written for work needs**, so the Rspec file is not written. Share the code for reference only, if you want to use it, please rewrite the core code.

Learned the source code of some Logstash output plugins: [logstash-output-kafka](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka), [logstash-output-rabbitmq](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-rabbitmq), [logstash-output-jdbc](https://github.com/theangryangel/logstash-output-jdbc)

## Versions

This demo is based on Logstash v6.4 and Rocketmq Client v4.2, other versions are not clear.

update 2019-03-12 : Tested on the latest version of Logstash v6.6 can also be successfully installed and used.

## Change Log

#### [v0.1.4] 2019-03-12

* add and mod configurations, the `topic`,`tag`,`key`,`body` attributes of the Message object can be formatted, for an example of formatting, you can refer to [Logstash configuration file example and description](https://github.com/PriestTomb/logstash-output-rocketmq/blob/master/example/README.md) (sorry, this document is only available in Chinese)

#### [v0.1.3] 2019-02-23

* add codec plugin, method `multi_receive` is modified into method `multi_receive_encoded`, so that the rocketmq plugin can configure the codec plugin to formatting the received event.

* fixes a bug about `RangeError: too big for byte` error occurs when Ruby's byte array is converted to Java's byte array.(This bug is currently known when there is Chinese in the event.)

#### [v0.1.2] 2019-01-20

* fixes a bug about Ruby instance variable.

#### [v0.1.1] 2019-01-19
